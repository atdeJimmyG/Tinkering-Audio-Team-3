## Contract #3 - Melody Generation (Non-Diegetic Audio) - [James Gill](https://github.com/atdeJimmyG)
**You are tasked with creating a tool which procedurally generates and exports
a music track for the game. It will be important to research some rules to see
which tones and samples go well with each other to design the synthesiser. An
ability to draw upon both tones and samples is expected! The style of music
is up to you as the developer, but should fit the creativity card brief and the
style of your particular game, but is anticipated to be somewhat simplistic and
retro.**

### Requirements:
* Create procedually generated melody
* Use both tones and samples
* Export the music track 

### Instructions:
1. Make sure contract 3 scene is selected
2. In the inspector, choose how long you want your music track to be (Using Sample Duration)
3. Run the scene 
4. Tones will be generated in the savedWAVs Folder (I wasn't able to to save the whole track as one .WAV, so each tone will need to be merged in another program)

## Contract #4 - User Interface Audio (Non-Diegetic Audio) - [Thomas O'Leary](https://github.com/thomasoleary)
**You need to develop a tool to generate audio for the user interface. These
should be short tones to feed back to the player that they are successfully
navigating the user interface and configuring the gameâ€™s settings. This should
be somewhat consistent across the interface, but the tones and samples
should be modified in a systematic way to indicate success or failure. A variety
of settings should be made available and configurable by a designer.**

### Requirements
* Be able to notify the user of their actions
* Tone varies based upon success & failure
* This tool must be made available & configurable to designers
